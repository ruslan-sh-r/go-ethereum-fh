// speculative execution.

// MiningEnabled determines if mining code should stay enabled even when firehose
// is active. In normal production setup, we always activate firehose on syncer node
// only. However, on local development setup, one might need to test speculative execution
// code locally. To achieve this, it's possible to enable firehose on miner, disable
// sync instrumentation and enable mining. This way, new blocks are mined, sync logs are
// not printed and speculative execution log can be accumulated.
var MiningEnabled = false

// BlockProgressEnabled enable output of finalize block line only.
//
// Currently, when taking backups, the best way to know about current
// last block seen is to track firehose logging. However, while doing
// the actual backups, it's not necessary to print all firehose logs.

// This settings will only affect printing the finalized block log line
// and will not impact any other firehose logs. If you need firehose
// instrumentation, activate firehose. The firehose setting has
// precedence over this setting.

//
// **Note** We use `interface{}` here instead of `*core.Genesis` because we otherwise
// have a compilation cycle because `core` package already uses `firehose` package.
// Consumer of this library make the cast back to the correct types when needed.
